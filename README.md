<h1>Multieffect Synth101</h1>
 <p>Implementation of a multi effect with phaser, flanger and wah-wah disposable in custom order. To bypassa a filter is only necessary to switch off the button that you find at the bottom of each pedal. Both frequency and time view of input and output signals are also implemented.The code can be simply be executed by running the code contained in the three parethesis at lines: 1, 7, 20, 135. To run the code a second time it is sufficient to run only the piece of code from line 135 onward. The first following picture shows the GUI when the frequency scope is represented, the second one instead when time response is plotted</p>

 <h2>Phaser</h2>
 <div>Frequency knob: Frequency of a sin wawe that modulates the delay of an all-pass filter.</div>
 <div>Dry/wet knob: Set how heavy the phaser effects the input signal.</div>
 
 <h2>Flanger</h2>
 <div>Frequency knob: Controls the frequency of a LFO that set the acting on the delay time</div>
 <div>Feedback knob: Set the amount of the feedback</div>
 <div>Width knob: Set the amplitude of the LFO described before</div>
 <div>Dry/wet knob: Set how heavy the flanger effects </div>
